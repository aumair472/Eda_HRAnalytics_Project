# 📊 Promotion Readiness Analysis – EDA Project
## A Data-Driven HR Analytics Case Study | GlobeHR

This project analyzes a large-scale HR dataset from a multinational organization (GlobeHR) operating across 28 regions with over 15,000 employees. The objective is to explore promotion patterns, identify key performance drivers, uncover potential biases, and prepare the dataset for machine learning.

This repository contains a full end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) pipeline, data cleaning workflows, visualizations, insights, and an ML-ready dataset.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Every year, GlobeHR conducts an internal promotion cycle. Leadership raised several concerns:

Only ~8% of employees were promoted.

Many high-performing employees may be overlooked.

Promotion decisions appear inconsistent across regions.

Biases related to gender, education, or region may exist.

The process is manual, slow, and lacks data-backed insights.

This project addresses these concerns using Python-based EDA and statistical analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives

Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling

Identify key drivers of employee promotion

Detect potential biases in gender, education, or region

Explore overlooked high-potential employees

Prepare a machine-learning-ready dataset

Provide actionable insights for HR policy improvement

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

## 📊 Key Findings (Short Summary)

KPI achievement, previous performance rating, and training scores are the strongest predictors of promotion.

Several high-potential employees are overlooked, especially in large departments.

Promotion rates vary significantly across regions and departments.

Award distribution disproportionately affects promotion outcomes.

HR should adopt a data-driven, standardized promotion framework.
